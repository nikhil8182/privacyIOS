Terms and Conditions (also called ToS – Terms of Service, Terms of Use or EULA – End User License Agreement) set the way in which your product, service or content may be used, in a legally binding way. Not only are crucial for protecting you from potential liabilities, but (especially in cases where something is being sold to consumers) they often contain legally mandated information such as users’ rights, withdrawal or cancellation disclosures.

In general, you’ll likely need to set Terms and Conditions if you have an app that participates in some form of commerce (whether selling to users directly or facilitating trading). Additionally, some specific instances where they might be needed are where you:

need to make legally required disclosures related to consumer rights (especially withdrawal and cancellation rights);
have different user levels (eg. registered vs non-registered);
your platform allows users to sell or trade with other users;
facilitate or otherwise process payments and/or other sensitive user data;
want to set the rules for user behavior and state grounds for termination of accounts;
participate in affiliate programs;
provide a software or service which can potentially cause harm if misused;
would like to have some legally enforceable control over, and set rules about, how your app may be used.
Particular emphasis should be given to account termination clauses, payment conditions and the limitation of liability clauses (and disclaimers).
